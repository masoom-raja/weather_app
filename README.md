Weather Reporting Application
• Developed a dynamic and user-friendly weather reporting application using React for the front end and Node.js for the back end, providing users with accurate and real-time weather data based on their location.
• Integrated third-party APIs such as OpenWeatherMap to fetch and display real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts. 
• Implemented advanced features like geolocation services, allowing users to automatically receive weather updates for their current location, and a search functionality for finding weather information in different cities.
